Easy
1.	Define the following terms: data, database, relational database, and table.
data-information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer.
database-a large amount of information stored in a computer system in such a way that it can be easily looked at or changed.
relational database- a type of database that organizes data into rows and columns, forming tables where data points are related to each other.
table-an arrangement of facts and numbers in rows or blocks, especially in printed material.
2.	List five key features of SQL Server.
data warehousing, mobile business intelligence, and scalability, optimising performance, enhancing security.
3.	What are the different authentication modes available when connecting to SQL Server? (Give at least 2)
Windows Authentication mode and mixed mode
Medium
4.	Create a new database in SSMS named SchoolDB.
CREATE DATABASE SchoolDB
5.	Write and execute a query to create a table called Students with columns: StudentID (INT, PRIMARY KEY), Name (VARCHAR(50)), Age (INT).
USE SchoolDB
CREATE TABLE Students (
StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY, 
Name VARCHAR(50), 
Age INT)
6.	Describe the differences between SQL Server, SSMS, and SQL.
 Differences
Aspect	SQL	SQL Server	SSMS
Type	Language	Database Software (RDBMS)	GUI Management Tool
Purpose	Query/manage databases	Store/manage data	Administer SQL Server visually
Vendor	Standard (ANSI/ISO)	Microsoft	Microsoft
Dependency	Used by many RDBMS	Runs as a service	Requires SQL Server to work

Hard
7.	Research and explain the different SQL commands: DQL, DML, DDL, DCL, TCL with examples.
Category	Commands	Function
DQL	SELECT	Retrieve data.
DML	INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE	Modify data.
DDL	CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE	Define/modify database structures.
DCL	GRANT, REVOKE	Control access permissions.
TCL	COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT	Manage transactions.
________________________________________
Key Notes
•	DQL vs. DML: SELECT is technically DQL, while INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are DML.
•	DDL vs. DML: DDL changes the database schema, while DML changes data within it.
•	TCL is critical for ensuring ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties in transactions.

8.	Write a query to insert three records into the Students table.\
INSERT INTO Students values
(1, 'Shahina', 18),
(2, 'Risolat', 20),
(3, 'Farida', 19)
Select* from Students
